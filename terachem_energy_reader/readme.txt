This utility will read an outfile printed by Terachem. It's harded for a 3-state system (s0, s1, s2). Run from command line like this: "python plots_outfiles outfile.txt". Y axis simply labeled "energy" as terachem has multiple energy unit options (Hartree, eV, etc), you can easily add this to the ylabel command in the plots_outfiles.py manually if there is a certain one you're using.
